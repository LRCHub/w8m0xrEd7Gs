Thinking back
I dive into the waves
Diamond light
upon the sea ablaze
This is where a piece of us
remains
But the nature of this place
can just crush your heart
So alarming
Blue the sky above
The next wave will come
so we swim out
The value will never fade away
So…
Reach out to the wind and
feel the beautiful now
It's limitless I believe
Keep chasing your dreams and
live the beautiful now
Let innocence set you free
Maybe this will ease your pain,
quiet all the static
Everyone in their own way
is beautiful, beautiful now
Journeyed on
and came a upon a star
Had a dream of falling from afar
Through the darkness
sinking like a stone
But beacon that you lit somehow
brought me home
New beginning
Red setting with the sun
Found the strength to go on
in your touch
In my dreams
you're always right beside me
Reach out to the wind and
feel the beautiful now
It's limitless I believe
Keep chasing your dreams and
live the beautiful now
Let innocence set you free
Realize the past won't change
What if you surrendered
to the wisdom of this wave?
The beautiful, beautiful now
Maybe this could ease your pain,
quiet all the static
Cause everyone in their own way
is beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful now
Reach out the wind and
feel the beautiful now
It's limitless I believe
Keep chasing your dreams and
live the beautiful now
Let innocence set you free
Face into the wind and
feel the beautiful now
It's limitless I believe
Hold on to your dreams and
live the beautiful now
Let all of this set you free
